Welcome! My name is Robert Jaquette and I am currently a PhD candidate at the Univeristy of Delaware's School of Marine Science and Policy. Generally my work pertains to the study of the marine aerosol production from breaking waves in the presence of wind. My goal to study the ejection velocities and production mechanisms of "large" inerial aerosols over the oceans surface. By understanding the initial dynamics and production rate of these droplets, models can better predict the impact that these droplets have on energy exchange at the ocean's surface. 

In totalility, our understanding marine aerosols impacts various topics such as hurricane intensification and climate change to predicting icing events on sea-faring vessels to even the transport of organic material. Please explore the page and reach out if you want to know anything more about my work.
